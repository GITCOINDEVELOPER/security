1 months back i reported a severe spamming bug on the platform through email: instbusinessofficial@gmail.com

Security team accepted that was actually a bug which could spam users, funders and bounty on the platform and can cause huge difficulty to them to manage bounties..

But after that i didn't got any update weather i should be rewarded or not, atleast i should have got the update

Thank you
